        Craftwood Text is simply dummy text used in typography and layout design.
    This text has been a standard filler for centuries, ever since an unknown typesetter
    jumbled up characters to create a sample page.
    It has endured through the ages, seamlessly transitioning into digital publishing while remaining largely unchanged.
    Its popularity surged in the mid-20th century with the introduction of specialized font sets,
    and later with the rise of digital design and desktop publishing software.
